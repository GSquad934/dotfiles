# DWM Status Bar
By default, DWM has a very plain bar with almost no information in it. The status bar can be customized with one/several BASH script(s). Here is what mine looks like:

These scripts must be in your *$PATH* for the status bar to work. The script called *dwmbar* is the one launching the status bar (add it to your *.xinitrc*) while all the other ones are used to retrieve the different information.

This bar integrates niceley with [my build of DWM](https://github.com/GSquad934/dwm).
