# DWM Status Bar
By default, DWM has a very plain bar with almost no information in it. The status bar can be customized with one/several BASH script(s). Here is what mine looks like:

* ðŸ“¦ 0 : indicates how many updates are available (script: *dwmupdates*)
* ðŸ–¥ 24% â–ƒ : indicates the CPU usage. The bar will fill-up if the CPU is used more (script: *dwmcpu*)
* ðŸ§  0.61GB/1.93GB : indicates the RAM usage (script: *dwmmemory*)
* â¬‡  7.9MB â¬†  48KB : indicates the download/upload network traffic usage (script: *dwmnet*)
* ðŸ’¾ 5.0G (18%) : indicates the disk space usage where "/" is mounted. Other disks can be added by modifying the script (script: *dwmdisk*)
* ðŸŒ¡ 0 : indicates the CPU temperature. (script: *dwmtemp*)
* ðŸ”Š 100% : indicates the volume level. The icon will change depending on the volume level (script: *dwmvol*)
* ðŸ•’ Mon, February 22 14:31 : indicates the current day, date and time in 24H format (script: *dwmclock*)

These scripts must be in your *$PATH* for the status bar to work. The script called *dwmbar* is the one launching the status bar (add it to your *.xinitrc*) while all the other ones are used to retrieve the different information.

This bar integrates niceley with [my build of DWM](https://github.com/GSquad934/dwm).
